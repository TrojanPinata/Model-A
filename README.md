# Model-A
A prototype keyboard based on a ATMEGA32U4 and powered by QMK

Features:
- Hotswappable keys
- Sick OLED side display
- Layers
- Cool knob for volume or whatever
- 75% layout because I want function keys

PCB is double sided bc of the hotswappable stuff and gd does that make this expensive
Acrylic will come later
